# Shortest-Path-Between-End-hosts

Using GENI.com, I was able to allocate resources from different sites in order to set up a connection with 6 end-hosts. Pinging each connection allowed for me to access the costs between each end host. I uploaded those costs into my Bellman-Ford algorithm (implemented in C++), and returned the shortest path from the Bellman-Ford node to other end hosts.

This project was used for my Networking course in college, and helped me visualize how distance vector and linked state algorithms worked, especially in a networking environment!
